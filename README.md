# Android Emulator Notification Killer

After Nox and LDPlayer developers ignored my hundreds of feedbacks to add the damn option to disable annoying installation notification, I have decided to develop a tool by my own to disable the notification by patching the executeable. It patches dnplayer.exe for all LDPlayer version, and Nox.exe and Qt5Widgets.dll for all Nox versions. Pardon my weird hex patches because lack of x86 assembly skills

### What about Nox ads notification?

Since it only shows once per day for me, it will be hard to test the patch. Until then, just close Nox Asst from tray or kill MultiPlayerManager.exe from task manager.

Note: This app requires administrator rights in order to patch the emulators

Any such report from your antivirus is a false positive and is due to how the application works. You must manually add the exe to your antivirus's whitelist/exclusion list. If you have security concerns, simply do not use the app. Instead, patch manually by hand using Hex editor.
