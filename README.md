# Android Emulator Notification Killer

After Nox and LDPlayer developers ignored my hundreds of feedbacks to add the damn option to disable annoying installation notification, I have decided to develop a tool by my own to disable the notification by patching the executeable. It can also patch Nox ads popup to prevent it from showing ads. It patches dnplayer.exe for all LDPlayer version, and Nox.exe, Qt5Widgets.dll, MultiPlayerManager.exe and for all Nox versions.

### What about ads inside running Emulator?

Just use [AdAway app](https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/releases). It's better if you use root so you don't have to use VPN mode

Note: This app requires administrator rights in order to patch the emulators

This tool will be flagged as HackTool.Patcher or similar, because it is indeed a patching tool. You must manually add the exe to your antivirus's whitelist/exclusion list. If you have security concerns, simply do not use the app. You can check the source, see how it patches and patch the file manually by hand using Hex editor.
